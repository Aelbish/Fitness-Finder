          <i
            >"The rate at which energy (calories) is used for the essential life
            functions is called Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR). Basal metabolism
            includes most of the involuntary things the human body does to
            support life â€“ such as breathing, blood circulation, body
            temperature regulation, nervous system operations, etc., but not the
            extra energy needed for any additional physical activity such as gym
            exercise. In other words, if you laid in bed all day doing nothing
            else, then you would need to eat at least the number of calories
            roughly equal to your BMR in order to maintain your normal body
            functions." </i
